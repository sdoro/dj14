# workspace for 5SX classes

## Requirements

1. You've completed (at least most of) Learn Python the Hard Way: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/

2. You've completed the official Django tutorial, also known as the Polls tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/

3. You're here: (http://c9.io/)

## Setup github and c9.io workspace (the easy way)

1. Create a github repository (e.g. dj14)
2. Create a new workspace in c9.io filling with the previous generated github repository (e.g. dj14)

Now the github *origin* IS in github.com:

    $ git remote -v
    origin  git@github.com:sdoro/dj14.git (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:sdoro/dj14.git (push)


## Using git

From now on we can use git commands as usual:

    make 'some' changes      # localy
    git add                  # localy
    git commit               # localy       # where: c9.io
    git push                 # remotely     # where: github.com
